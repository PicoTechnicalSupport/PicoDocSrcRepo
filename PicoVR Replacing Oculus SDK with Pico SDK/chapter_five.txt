5	Replacing the Oculus SDK with the Pico SDK in other Projects
==============================================================================

Other Oculus projects can be updated in a similar way as the video player example. Such projects involve the following:

- The Oculus player is based on the **GearVrControllerTest** scene.

- A room can be replaced by following all of the steps described in the previous section.

- A cube can be replaced by following steps 1 to 3 in the previous section.

- To update a basic scene, just replace **MainCamera** with the **Pvr_UnitySDK** prefab.
