4 Manual Modification Scheme
=================================================

- Step1:get the configuration file “SystemKeyConfig.prop”; (available on: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ygjq3LdjU_jsbZRwyrpWcxysOe3GieKS)

- Step2:Open the configuration file "SystemKeyConfig.prop" with Notepad

- Step3:Modify the definitions of keys

  The key values of the home keys include "tap" "double-tap" “long press” as follows:

=========================     =====================
action_home_single_tap        Tap
action_home_double_tap 	  	  Double-tap
action_home_long_press        Long press
=========================     =====================

  The above key values can be set at 0/1/2/3/4/5/6/7. The response corresponding to each value is as below: 
      
      0: Invalid;
      
      1: boot the applications in the specified package names or generic names; 
      
      2: Back to Launcher; 
      
      3: boot settings; 
      
      4: Back;
      
      5: No function, only sending the key notice;
      
      6: Correct the positive direction of vision;
      
      7: Clean up the memory. 

  The values of the Power key include tap: 

    action_power_press			Tap
	
  The key values may be set at: 0/1; 

	  0: Invalid;
	  
	  1: Back;
    	
  Change the values after the key values according to the needs, and assign different functions to each key value respectively; 
    
  Example: Change the “Home” key to the “back” function, and just modifying the "action_home_single_tap = 4" is fine.
    
  Set the “double-tap” interval and“long press” duration (in milliseconds) as below: 
    
======================     ====================================================
time_home_double_tap 	   time gap between the two Home button click (ms)
time_home_long_press 	   duration of Home button long press function (ms)
======================     ====================================================
    
Set the to-be-booted applications in the specified package names and generic names, as below: 
    
    action_home_XXX_package=YYY
    
    action_home_XXX_class=ZZZ
    
    XXX refers to “single tap”, “double tap” and “long press”, respectively corresponding to single_tap, double_tap, long_press
	
    YYY replaces the package name of the to-be-booted application 

    ZZZ replaces the generic name of the to-be-booted application


- Step4:Open adb, and copy files to the data/local/tmp directory. Instructions are as follows: 

  adb push SystemKeyConfig.prop /data/local/tmp/

- Step5: Reboot the device.

  Remarks: Modification of the “Home” key definition just is only applicable to the “Home” key on the helmet body; the definition of the “Home” key on the supporting handle still cannot be customized.
