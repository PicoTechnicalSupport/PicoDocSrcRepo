9 	Auxiliary Tools
====================================

9.1 ShowFPS
--------------------------------------

To show the frame rate, navigate to the **Inspector** panel of the Pvr_UnitySDK and enable **Show FPS in Scene** under the **Pvr_Unity SDK Manager** component.

9.2 Scene Switch Gradient Effect
--------------------------------------

The SDK provides a scene switch gradient effect through the **Screen Fade** option:

The duration and color of the scene switching gradient are controlled by the **Fade Time** (in seconds) and **Fade Color** options respectively:

9.3 Setting the Framerate
--------------------------------------

The SDK provides an option to set the framerate:

Disable **Use Default FPS** and then enter the desired frame rate.

9.4 Configuring the Render Text Size
--------------------------------------

The SDK provides the option to configure the size of the **Eyebuffer**, which is opened by unchecking the **Use Default RenderTexture** option as follows:

**Tips**:
Developers should only use **Use Default RenderTexture** for custom render texture sizes for special needs. Developers should take the following into consideration:

* If the render texture setting is too small, performance will improve and latency will be reduced, but it will also result in a lower resolution.
* If the render texture setting is too large, performance will be reduced and latency will be increased. It’s not recommended that the render texture setting exceed the texture size for the hardware.
