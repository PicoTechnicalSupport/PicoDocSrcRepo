**8.Q:** Why does the Goblin handle flash in game from time to time?

**A:** Because the UE4 game logic is not in the same thread as the rendering, Epic is the motion of the smooth motion controller, it will be defaulted that the position and orientation of the motion controller will be updated before rendering, but this practice will also create a bug in which the model flashes from time to time. To circumvent this flashing, it is only necessary to select the Motion Controller component and check Disable Low Latency Update in its details panel:
