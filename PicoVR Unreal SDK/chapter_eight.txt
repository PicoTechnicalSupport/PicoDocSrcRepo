8.4	Pico Neo Security Zone
--------------------------------------

The security zone of the Pico Neo is similar to that of the Oculus Rift Guardian and the SteamVR Chaperone. The system will show a notice when the player is out of the safe range (e.g. when the player runs into an obstacle such as a wall). Even though the VR all-in-one device is restricted by the inside-out tracking functionality and has no external sensor to input the absolute safe area axes, we still recommend developers set a range value to ensure the player’s safety.

One method to accomplish this, is to define the **Actor** blueprint class as the safe area in the form of a cylinder, with the normals facing to the inner side to remind the player of the range of the safe area:

.. image:: _static/8.4c.png    

Figure 8.5 - Safe area.

We recommend adding the ``Actor Safe Area`` node shown in Figure 8.5 after the ``BeginPlay`` event for the ``DefaultPawn`` of the scene:

.. image:: _static/8.4d.png   

Figure 8.6 - Adding a safe area.

After this has been configured, the safe area can be dynamically shown or hidden according to the camera or MotionController’s position relative to the parent component.

The ``Actor Safe Area`` blueprint class provides two methods to get and set the radius value of the safe area:

Figure 8.7 - Functions of the safe area.

We recommend that developers give users the ability to set the range of the safe area, based on their surrounding environment.

8.5	Enabling 6DoF for Pico Neo
--------------------------------------

The SDK defaults to **3DoF** for head and hand tracking. 


Use the following steps to enable 6DoF tracking for devices such as the **Pico Neo**, that support **6DoF** tracking functionality:

1.	Navigate to **Edit** > **Project Settings** > **Plugins** > **Pico Neo**.
2.	Enable **Enable HMD 6 Dof Module?** and **Enable Controller 6 Dof Module**.
