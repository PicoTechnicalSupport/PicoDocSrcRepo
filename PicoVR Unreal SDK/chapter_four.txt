4 	Quickstart
======================================

Use the steps in the following subsections to create a new project in UE4 using the SDK.

**Note:** The SDK supports both blueprint and C++ projects.

4.1 	Create a New Project
----------------------------------

Create a new **Blank** blueprint project. Ensure that the target hardware is set to **Mobile / Tablet** and the target graphic level is set to **Scalable 3D or 2D**:

**Note:** Ensure that the **Folder** and **Name** do not contain Chinese characters.


4.2 	Set Project Compatibility
----------------------------------

Use the following steps to ensure that the project is compatible with the SDK:

1. Save the current map.

2. Navigate to **Edit > Project Setting > Project > Maps and Modes** and set **Editor Start Map** and **Game Default Map** to **NewMap**:

8. Open the project.

9. Navigate to **Menu > Edit > Plugins**, and disable all the options under **Built-in > Virtual Reality**. At this point, the editor will prompt to restart. **Close** the editor instead of restarting it.

4.3 	Import the SDK
----------------------------------

1. With the editor closed, copy the **Plugins** directory to the project’s root directory:

2. Double-click on the project name to reopen it.

3. If you use UE4.20+,the system will display a prompt indicating that the SDK modules are not compiled. Click **Yes (Y)** to continue:

4.4 	Complete the Project
----------------------------------

1. Create a **Pawn** blueprint class and add a **Scene** component to it.

2. Add a **Camera** component to the **Scene** component under the **DefaultSceneRoot** assembly.

After being packaged and mounted to the helmet, the relative position/pose of the **Camera** will be refreshed in real time according to the helmet allows for head tracking and stereo rendering.

3.	Drag the Pawn into the scene and set **Auto Possess Player** to **Player 0**:

4.5 	Package the Project
----------------------------------

The texture compression format supported by the Pico Neo and Pico Goblin is **ASTC**. Use the following steps to select this format when packaging the project:

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** and enable **Package game data inside .apk?** in the **Platforms** sub items. This ensures that the data can be packaged into an apk.

2. Select **File > Package Project > Android > Android (ASTC)**:
