Welcome to the Pico Virtual Reality (VR) Android SDK Developer Guide for Unreal Engine 4 (UE4). The Pico VR Android SDK for Unreal Engine 4 (SDK) provides the following functionality for Pico’s VR devices: sensor fusion, binocular stereo rendering, optical distortion correction, asynchronous time distortion, single buffer rendering, 3DoF/6DoF multi-interaction support, multiple peripheral support, compatibility for AR/VR software and hardware platforms, big data analysis and statistics, power and cooling management, and account and payment management. 

The SDK allows the position/orientation of the camera component in the engine to follow the movements of Pico’s VR helmet, so that the engine's MotionController component will follow the Pico motion controller.

The engine’s API can be used to control a Pico VR hardware device. For example, the input, head mounted display (HMD), reset orientation, and position functions can be used to implement the gesture/position reset function of the HMD. Blueprint interfaces are provided for some Pico VR-specific features.
